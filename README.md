This is my first videogame project, it currently has over 2k downloads and 4.3 star rating.

I used gamemaker for general programming of the game, Photoshop and Acesprite for graphic design and Garageband for Audio/Music.

Bolivian Adventure is a platformer game is inspired by my country Bolivia, it's full of cultural references.  It currently has
3 levels and a final Boss level.

Plans to update the game and fix the bugs are paused until I find a job and get my financials in order.
